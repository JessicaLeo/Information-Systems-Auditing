<h1><b>System Proposal:</b></h1>
<p>
    IT Auditing System for small businesses is a system that allows users to
    create profiles, based on their profiles they are asked questions about
    their current security procedures. Based on those answers the system
    tells them if they are compliant, semi compliant or need more procedures in
    place. The site will also have resources for users to see what they need.
